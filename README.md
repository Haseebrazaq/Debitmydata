Debitmydata proof of work proof of future is a hypothetical system that combines the features of Debitmydata, proof of work and proof of future. It would allow users to share their personal data with companies using custom logo facial recognition and earn money in return. It would also use a blockchain network that relies on proof of work and proof of future to verify and secure the data transactions.
